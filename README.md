# Supply-Chain-Analysis

The supply Chain is the network of production and logistics involved in producing and delivering goods to customers. And Supply Chain Analysis means analyzing various components of a Supply Chain to understand how to improve the effectiveness of the Supply Chain to create more value for customers.

To analyze a company’s supply chain, we need data on the different stages of the supply chain, like data about sourcing, manufacturing, transportation, inventory management, sales and customer demographics.
I found a dataset for this task which includes data about the supply chain of a Fashion and Beauty startup. You can download the dataset from https://lnkd.in/dtjsHQfX .
